Project Title:  Patient Monitoring and Control System using Internet of Things


Description of the latest similar system:
Patient Monitoring System is an Arduino based Patient monitoring system. In this System, Sensors are connected with the Arduino and Ethernet Shield. The Program is typed on the IDE. The Arduino connected to the computer using the USB cable. The Ethernet shield is ensured that it is connected using an Ethernet cable to a LAN. The Program to Control various sensors first compiled and verified and uploaded to Arduino. The output can be checked on the monitor by using the IP address.
In This System, These Hardware components are used: - Arduino UNO, Pulse Rate Sensor, LM35, Sensor MQ2, LCD 16X2.
All these Sensors will collect the data from the patient and then will be analyzed by the system, which will later send to the server by WIFI using an internet connection. Doctors can check the data anywhere using a browser and internet connection.

Limitations of the latest similar system:
1.	Only collect the data when the command is given.
2.	There is no Notification while something went wrong.
3.	Arduino UNO is used, while BeagleBone series is much better.








Final Solution:
 Proposed System:

The Proposed System focuses on overcoming all the three limitation with the existing system. The Ardunino Uno is being repalced by Beaglebone Black
and a GSM module is added in order to send message to doctors phone as an alter system. The system also uses ThingSpeak as cloud storage and keeps
on updating the data.

Features 
	Use of BeagleBone Black as the master of the system, TP Link version as WIFI dongle.
	Use of DS18B20 as Temperature sensor, Arterial blood pressure sensor, MIKEROE-200 as heart Rate sensor.
	ThingSpeak for data cloud data storage which keeps updated data. 
	UART serial communication for GSM module and IEEE 802.11 set protocol for WIFI dongle.
	Use of preemptive scheduler operation to remove the problem of hang or slow down, tick rate for accuracy, fixed task priority using Rate monotonic scheduling.
